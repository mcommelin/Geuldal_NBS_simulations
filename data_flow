# Order of data processing
goal of this document is to structure where the base data for the Geuldal is stored
and how this is processed to the final LISEM input database.

# current problems
1. single source maps not working well
    the workflow from 1 base map to different resolutions is not working well
    this causes problem switching between resolutions

base maps + derivatives:

rasters:
dem_5m
landuse_5m
ndvi_10m - date specific !!!!

vectors:
ubc_soils_5m

roads
buildings
build_up_area
tilestorage
hard_surface

buffers
buffer_outlet
ponds
channels
    - location/mask
    - width
    - depth
    - type (ditch/stream)
    - culvert
    - culvert diameter


generated maps:
ID.map
subcatchments
outpoints
inithead_20m - date specific

Idea:
1. sharepoint version control directory for maps
2. R code to go from vector to raster specific for each resolution.
