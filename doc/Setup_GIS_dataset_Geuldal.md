## Introduction

This document described the steps to collect GIS data an prepare information for
the simulation of NBS measures. This work is financially supported by the LandEX
project.

Many different data sources are collected. First we start with downloading open 
datasets for topography and elevation.

## Downloaded datasets

We first start with a 25 meter resolution DTM which we obtain from OpenDEM:
[opendem website](https://www.opendem.info/opendemeu_download_highres.html)

For topography we use the QuickOSM pluging in QGIS. We download the preset Urban
data and 

Based on this we derive the basin size of the Geul catchment by placing
