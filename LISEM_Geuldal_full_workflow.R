# Initialization ---------------------------------------------------------------

# load and set configured settings from config.yaml
source("sources/r_scripts/configuration.R")

# 1. Data preparation --------------
# Where possible automatize GIS data management to create base data layers
# for the whole Geul catchment

# !! All datetime data in the project is in GMT+1 !!

## 1.1 make base maps ----------------------------------------------------------
# run the code from 'create_base_maps_lisem.R' this now includes a lot of 
# manual work in QGIS - but it will result in tif files for all basemaps.

#Notes on manual adjustments!

## 1.2 catchment delineation ----------------------------------------------------
# catchment delineation based on DEM and the local drain direction on 20
# meter resolution. 
# currently done manually with steps:
# 1. copy coordinates of outlet close to Juliana channel from QGIS to text file
# 2. with PCRaster col2map make map of the outlet (mask = dem_region.map)
# 3. run delineate_catchment.mod script to find the catchment area.
# 4. resample based on the 5 and 20m mask.map to the correct extent
# 5. run the pcr_script 'base_ldd.mod' to make the ldd.map

# Result: based on this dem.map and catchment.map and ldd.map are made for 5 and 20 m.

## 1.3 preparation of precipitation and discharge data -------------------------
# with the script 'prepare_rainfall_discharge_lisem.R' the radar precipitation
# is processed to input for OpenLISEM, including a ID.map with 1km2 grid.
# this script calls 'KNMI_precipitation.R' which download 5 minute radar data
# from the KNMI data portal. It downloads the days of the selected events.

## 1.4 convert to PCRaster maps ------------------------------------------------
# convert base maps to PCraster LISEM input on 5 and 20 meter resolution.

# load the list of base maps.
base_maps <- readLines("sources/base_maps.txt")

# convert the required base maps
source("sources/r_scripts/source_to_base_maps.R") #function to transform tif to .map

## 1.6 make SWATRE soil tables -------------------------------------------------

# for the simulations of infiltration we use the SWATRE mobel inside OpenLISEM
# this requires the van Genuchten parameters for differents soil layers for
# each identified soil and landuse combination. 
# To estimate these parameters from variables we know a modelling / equation
# workflow is used.
# Based on soil texture, organic matter and management we calculate the input
# for SWATRE by first applying Saxton&Rawls 2006 equations and than the Rosetta
# (v3) model.

# Additional preparation of baseflow

#WARNING for the calibration of 20230622 we use observed baseflow for 10, 4, 14, 12 and 18.
# still need to update this better in the code!!!!!

#1. If not done run the function from 2.2 for the full Geul_catchment
#create_lisem_run(20, 1)

# copy baseflow.map to full run
#file.copy(from = "LISEM_data/Geul_5m/maps/baseflow.map", to = "LISEM_runs/Geul_5m/maps", overwrite = T)
#file.copy(from = "LISEM_data/Geul_20m/maps/baseflow.map", to = "LISEM_runs/Geul_20m/maps", overwrite = T)

# run the pcrscript to prepare the baseflow maps 'sources/pcr_scripts/baseflow_calculations.mod'
# update the runfile, set the option: stationary baseflow as map = 1 to 0.
# run the model until the first calculations start.
# copy the resulting baseinflow.map from the results folder to 'LISEM_data/Geul_xm/maps'

# After these steps rebuild the desired subcatchments and LISEM runs

#-#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# The base maps etc for the data are now finished
# All other steps can be done by adjusting PCRaster scripts
#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


# 2. Create LISEM runs for subcatchments ---------------------------------------
# we use subcatchments to test the model setup and do the calibration
# the used subcatchments are (ID number points table):
# Watervalderbeek (10), Eyserbeek (14)
# Kelmis (18), Gulp (4), Lemiers (12)
# Sippenaeken (90) -> 1km2 for testing only 

## 2.1 prepare subcatchments ----------------------------------------------------

# PCR scripts called in this function: 
# 1. delineate_catchment.mod   = make the subcatchment
# 2. ldd_subcatch.mod          = if 'calc_ldd = TRUE' - make ldd for subcatchment
# 3. base_maps_subcatch.mod    = cut other basemaps to correct size.

# the aim of this function is to only do data management and not influence 
# important settings for calibration etc, these all should be part of the next
# function.

points_id <- c(14) # use if you want to update multiple subcatchments on the go
reso <- c(5,20)
# load the function for subcatchment preparation
source("sources/r_scripts/create_subcatch_db.R")

# run for both resolutions and all selected subcatchments
for (i in seq_along(points_id)) {
  for (j in seq_along(reso)) {
    base_maps_subcatchment(
      cell_size = reso[j],
      sub_catch_number = points_id[i],
      calc_ldd = TRUE, # only recalculate ldd if first time or dem is changed, takes some time!!
      parallel = FALSE  # the map resampling can be done parallel, on windows this causes errors, then set to false.
    )
  }
}

# you can also run for one specific subcatchment e.g.

#base_maps_subcatchment(cell_size = 20, sub_catch_number = 10, calc_ldd = FALSE, parallel = FALSE)

# this databases can be used to create a LISEM run. Choices in settings or
# calibration values can be set in this stage.

## 2.2 make lisem runs ------------------------------------------------

# this function mainly works for manual calibration
# to do many runs exploring a parameter space, code is developed in section 3.

# options to adjust/calibrate LISEM input:
#' 1. the landuse table including OM values.
#'      in section 1.5 this table is made 'cal_factors' can be adjusten or the
#'      resulting LISEM_data/tables/lu.tbl can be adjusted before running the 
#'      swatre code in 1.6
#' 2. the resulting swatre input parameters from section 1.6 can be adjusted 
#'      for each UBC code. A ksat, npar and alpha map are made in each run to
#'      better grasp these values.
#'      WARNING this input effects all lisem runs of the Geulcatchment!!
#'      you can always go back the base settings by loading the base file in the function.
#' 3. the channel mannings n properties: see sources/setup/tables/
#' 
#' PCRaster scripts used in the function:
#' 1.  baseflow_cal.mod  = calculates baseflow for subcatchments on 20230622 
#'                - if more events/subcatch needed adjust code and csv file
#' 2. prepare_db.mod     = main script making most of the maps, channels and culverts
#' 3. storm_drans.mod    = script making storm drains in urban area 
#'                          - contains hard coded drain size!

# the runfile template file should be updated manually if the model has new options
# stored in : 'sources/setup/runfile_template.run'

points_id <- c(14) # use if you want to update multiple subcatchments on the go
#swatre_file <- "cal_OM_test.csv" # use if you want to change the swatre params file on the go

## 2.3 Simulation and figure ---------------------------------------------------
# select a subcatchment and event from the LISEM_runs folder structure
# manually execute the LISEM run
# when finished this function below will make a graph of the discharge including
# a Goodness-of-fit calculation
# point_id = number of the subcatchment point
# resolution = resolution of the simulation (5 or 20 m)
# clean_up = do you want to empty the results directory after the figure
#             is made - advise is TRUE!
# if the runfile name has changed from the default date format set
# run_date = "20230622" # the date as character string
# if the result directory is not 'res' set
# res_dir = <res_folder_name>

# the resulting figure is stored in ./images/simulations/
