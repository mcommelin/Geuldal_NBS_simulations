#' Calculations of discharge based on cross-sections etc.
#' Based on the book 'Hydrometry' by Boiten.
#' 
#' Velocity measurement based on 1 point method (p82).
#' Assuming that the waterdepth at .6 of the depth is about 
#' the mean.
#' 
#' The following calculation of the discharge is done with the
#' mid section method (p85). Since the cross section bins are not equally spaced.
#'
#'The flow speed is calculated from the equations provided with the flow meter
